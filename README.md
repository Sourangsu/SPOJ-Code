SPOJ
====

The repository hosts all the codes and the problem statements of all the problems I have solved on Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ).

You are free to check out the codes and learn how I went about solving the problems but I would not advice you to just copy and paste the codes into SPOJ. These codes are just for educational purposes.

I like to code in : C, C++ & Python(Occasionally)
